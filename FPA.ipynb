puts spin operating system I dont feel like Im using Android This feels different It doesnt level customization Android users come appreciate That said Amazon Prime member device tailored content entertainment machine Its simply fun way consume magazines books etcThere 3 onscreen buttons bottom device The middle button immediately takes home screen The button left acts sort back button It also lets get rid keyboard I dont need screen open The button right super important It took couple days realize That square shaped button press see apps open It lets switch apps also lets see apps open close You close pressing X button corner window appears touching app window swiping right If leave apps open never close youll drain battery Make sure use little square button clear appsThe device several menus swipe left view First start home screen You literally stay screen anything need tablet All apps housed You swipe view The tablet comes several apps preinstalled Slik Amazons internet browser Audible Good Reads Amazon app store weather app etc You go Amazon app store download apps Twitter Facebook etc You combine apps page folders You drag one app another app folder appears This made home screen much manageable You change size font home screen normal large small device settings This feature doesnt necessarily increase size font within apps however I believe changes font main screensIf magazine newspaper subscription connected device new issues show top home page screen heading new items The device comes free 6 month subscription Washington Post Youll see new items initially activate tabletYou change wallpaper screen use one photos You settings menu device If want use one photos however need either take device move Amazons Photos app cloudbased appSo far I havent found way effectively use different photo management app let change wallpaper Im crazy Amazon Photo app I found annoying move photos phone Amazons cloud I could view tablet That said Im planning take photos device I wanted pet photos ability change wallpaperBeyond home screen swipe right view screen They prearranged books videos games shop apps music audiobooks newstand All screens

capability If youre Amazon Prime member Amazon periodically download video device thinks might like The items dont count preinstalled memory automatically deleted memory starts getting full You turn deck feature dont like Ive content video playback capability This isnt major use device images look fine audio OK Ill talk speakers later My favorite feature tablet viewing magazine content Newstand Ive tried 3 magazines look gorgeous Now I always magazines Im stuck airport doctors office I always One regular magazines includes free digital version magazine free I connect account device This allows download back issues magazine long Ive account My magazine didnt include digital edition I canceled print edition switched digital version It inexpensive magazine anyway There several magazines try free 30 days device I third magazine decided keep year Viewing magazines gadget pleasureThe Kindle Fire doesnt come Google Play store installed You side load device without rooting breaking warranty You Google find instructions Its difficult youre fairly comfortable technology It probably took 10 minutes Most apps I wanted Amazon store handful I paid Google Play The way I could go back access store They worked fine far I despise keyboard Amazon preinstalled device There lines letters keyboard I suppose designed better swyping keys I hate I fixed problem going Google Play downloading new keyboard It pretty easy problem solve I cant complainApps connecting Internet little slow load device compared gadgets generally doesnt bother If using tablet replace personal laptop however might drive crazy The screen device isnt bad If I compare fancy phone shape think price device compared smartphone screen outstandingThe speakers OK There two located bottom screen I wont say fantastic They arent In opinion fine watching YouTube television show They OK listening music audiophile You make little better downloading different music app instead relying preinstall app still music sound tinny That said always connect tablet bluetooth speaker use pair headphones etcThis device wasnt made taking pictures It front back camera arent designed spectacular Im using themI find device little difficult hold hands I think thats partly size partly feels slick Also I hand problems similar someone Carpal Tunnel syndrome I think easier handle case arrives Im still waiting Im greatly enjoying
